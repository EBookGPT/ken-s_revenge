Please provide the input you want me to insert. I need the text you want me to use to create the outline. 

For example, you could provide:

* **A revised plan:**  Perhaps you've already incorporated some of the feedback and want me to create an outline based on your updated notes.
* **Specific details:**  You could give me more information about the characters, their relationships, and the specific events that drive the plot. 
* **Additional information:** Anything else that will help me understand your vision for the story and how the outline should be structured. 

The more information you give me, the better I can understand your story and create a detailed and helpful outline.
